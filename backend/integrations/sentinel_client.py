"""
Talk to Sentinel, the machine's memory/VRAM guardian, over its named pipe.

**This is a copy of Dexter's `backend/sentinel_client.py`, kept byte-identical
apart from this docstring and the client name the module-level `client()`
factory uses.** Re-sync it by copying Dexter's file over and re-applying those
two edits; diffing the two is meant to show nothing else.

The Studio never loads a model itself, so it does not `Register` or `Reserve`.
It has exactly one thing to ask: an `lm_studio` request against a server with
JIT loading turned on will pull several GB of weights onto the card, and the
Studio is the last party in that chain that can still choose not to. So it
calls `query()` first — which books nothing — and falls through to the next
provider when the answer is no.

Everything here is best-effort and non-blocking by design. Sentinel not being
installed, not running, or being slow must never make the Studio slower: every
call has a short timeout and returns an "absent" value on any failure. Nothing
in the Studio may depend on this succeeding.

Transport is the same newline-delimited JSON the Sentinel tray speaks, and the
JSON shapes are serde's default externally-tagged enums, e.g.
``{"Query": {"client": "buzzcaf", "mib": 6144}}`` in and
``{"Reserved": {...}}`` back.
